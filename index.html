          A personal lens: glass bending rays That gave one that day’s news
          Saying each and every day, Just remember you are standing On a planet
          that’s evolving. How beautiful, she thought, what distance does For
          water, the view from above or afar. In last night’s dream, they were
          back again At the beginning. She was a child And he was a child. A
          plane lit down and left her there. Cold whitening the white sky
          whiter. Then a scalpel cut her open for all the world To be a sea.
